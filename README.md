## 🧩 Project Overview

This repository contains a series of practical tasks focused on learning and applying **jQuery fundamentals**.  
The project covers element selection, style manipulation, effects, animations, DOM updates, and a small interactive project.

Each task builds on the previous one and demonstrates how jQuery simplifies JavaScript-based interactions on a web page.

## 🚀 Part 1. Getting Started with jQuery

### ✅ Task 0. Setup

- Connected the **jQuery library** using a CDN link.
- Implemented a basic **document ready** function to ensure scripts run after the page loads.

### ✅ Task 9. Sequential Animations

- Created chained animations:
  - move right

  - shrink
  - return to the starting position
- Learned how jQuery queues animations sequentially.

---

### ✅ Task 10. Combined Animation

- Combined multiple effects:
  - movement
  - resizing
  - opacity change
- Applied complex transformations in a single animation.

## 🖼 Part 5. Mini Project

### 🌟 Task 11. Interactive Image Gallery

For the final task, I developed an **interactive image gallery**:

- Clicking a thumbnail smoothly enlarges the image.
- Combines:
  - jQuery effects
  - DOM manipulation
  - animations

This project summarizes and applies all the skills learned throughout the course.
