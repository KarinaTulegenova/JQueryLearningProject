Part 1. Getting Started with jQuery
Task 0. Setup
First, I connected the jQuery library using a CDN link.
Then I wrote a basic document ready function to make sure the script only runs after the page
has fully loaded.
To test it, I printed “jQuery is ready!” in the browser console, confirming that everything was
working correctly.
Task 1. Selectors & CSS
In this part, I learned how to select elements by their ID, class, and tag using jQuery.
I changed the text and HTML content of different elements and applied new styles
dynamically.
This helped me understand how to manipulate both content and appearance through jQuery
methods.
Part 2. jQuery Effects
Task 2. Visibility Methods
I created a paragraph and two buttons, Hide and Show.
Then I used visibility methods to hide, show, and toggle the paragraph’s visibility.
It demonstrated how jQuery can easily control the display of elements.
Task 3. Fade Methods
In this task, I added a cute cat GIF instead of a static image.
I used fading effects to make the image smoothly appear, disappear, or toggle between
visible and hidden.
It was a good exercise in applying visual transitions.
Task 4. Slide Methods
I created a collapsible panel that could slide up, slide down, or toggle between open and
closed states.
This task showed how sliding animations can make interface elements more dynamic and
interactive.
Part 3. DOM Manipulation with jQuery
Task 5. Add & Remove Elements
Here, I created a list with two buttons: one to add new list items and another to remove them.
I practiced dynamically modifying the structure of the webpage by adding and removing
elements.
Task 6. Modifying Attributes
In this task, I worked with HTML attributes.
I made a button that changes an image source when clicked, and another one that updates a
hyperlink address dynamically.
Task 7. Form Interaction
I created a form with input fields for Name and Email.
When the user types something, their input is displayed live below the form.
This helped me understand how to handle user input and show real-time feedback.
Part 4. Animations
Task 8. Basic Animation
I animated a square div by increasing its size and moving its position.
This demonstrated how jQuery can smoothly change an element’s properties over time.
Task 9. Sequential Animations
Next, I made the box move in several directions step by step — right, down, shrink, and
return to the starting point.
This helped me understand how to create chained animations.
Task 10. Combined Animation
Here I combined several animation effects — movement, resizing, and opacity changes — all
in one action.
It showed how multiple visual transformations can be applied at once for a more complex
effect.
Part 5. Mini Project
Task 11. Interactive jQuery Project
For the final task, I chose to create an Image Gallery.
The gallery displays small thumbnails that fade in and out, and when a user clicks on one, it
enlarges smoothly.
This project combined all the skills I learned — effects, DOM manipulation, and animation
— into one interactive web component.
